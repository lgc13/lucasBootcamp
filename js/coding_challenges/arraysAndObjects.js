/*
    Create 5 different user objects
        - each with at least 5 different fields
        - 1 field must be `age`
        - 1 field must be `salary`
        - 1 field must be `favoriteColor
        - 1 field must be `luckyNumber` // at least one person must have 7

    Create a function for each of the following problems (each function must be called once per user):

    1. Give me a list of all the users (entire object) who are about to retire (older than 59)
    2. Give me a list of al the users who are not allowed to drink (younger than 21)
    3. Give me a list of users that underpaid (anyone who makes less than 30000)

    4. Tell me the total $ we spend on employee salaries per year (total of all salaries)
        // output is a number
    5. Tell me the total amount of people who like the color "red"
        // output is a number
    6. Tell me the first (and only) person whose lucky number is 7
        // output is an object

    Input for all of them: list of objects (list of users)
    Output: depends on the ask (list, number, object)

// example:
const user1 = {
    name: "lucas",
    // add required fields like age, salary, favoriteColor, luckyNumber
}
// add 4 more users

// create 6 functions as mentioned above

// call each function once, passing in your list of users
