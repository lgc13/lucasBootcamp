/*
    Each person object should have at least 10 different fields 
        - at least 1 field of each data type you know, minus object/function
        Data types:
            - String
            - Number
            - Boolean
            - Null
            - Undefined
            - List(array)
            - Function
            - Objects

    Create at least 3 objects, pass them in as you want


    1. Create functions that will take in an object
    Each function will return me a different field (should have 10 min in total), one function per field

    2. Create functions that will take in an object, and a field change
    Each function will return my updated object


    Examples:

    1. function a
    input: 1 person object
    output: person first name (string)

    function b
    input: 1 person object
    output: person last name (string)

    2. function a
    input: 1 person object, 1 string (newName)
    output: 1 person (which has an updated name)
