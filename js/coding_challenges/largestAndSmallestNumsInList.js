/*
Find the largest and smallest number in a list 
Assume the list size is X - you can't hard code it...
Assume the items in the list are NOT in order
Assume the items in the list could very well be negative, decimal numbers
ex: [50, -2, 0, 100, 7....]

Expected output: 
Largest number: 100
Smallest number: -2

*/



// Acceptable answers:
const numbers = [1, -100, 2, 0, 100, 7, 150, -40, -900000]

// find largest number

        largestNumber = number
    }
    console.log("---- ending loop! ---- ")

// find me the smallest number
console.log("...... SMALLEST NUMBER!!!!! .....")
